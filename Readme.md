Test Automation For Premier Farnell Site Registration
======================================================

### Framework Design Approach
Selenium-cucumber is a behavior driven development (BDD) approach to write automation test script to test Web. Framework has been built using Page Object Model and Page Factory. 
Page Object Model is a design pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. Page Factory is an inbuilt Page Object Model concept for Selenium WebDriver but it is very optimized. With the help of PageFactory class, we use annotations @FindBy to find WebElement and use initElements method to initialize web elements. 
WebDriverManager library is used, which allows to automate the management of the binary drivers (e.g. chromedriver, geckodriver, etc.) required by Selenium WebDriver.
